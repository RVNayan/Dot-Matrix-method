This Python code uses Matplotlib library for generating a Dot matrix. Make sure this feature is installed before running the code. If you haven't then type the following command line in the terminal

    pip install matplotlib

This will install all the required libraries for the code.

Enter You're test sequences in the text files labelled as Sequence1.txt and Sequence2.txt. and run the code

Note that the above plot is inversed and in Actual studies the plot is drawn in the fourth quadrent.
In Bioinformatics, a dot plot is a graphical method that allows the comparison of two 
biological sequences and identify regions of close similarity between them.

A dot plot is a simple, yet intuitive way of comparing two sequences, either DNA or 
protein, and is probably the oldest way of comparing two sequences.
